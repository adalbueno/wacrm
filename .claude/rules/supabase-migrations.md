# Supabase Migrations

Scope: `supabase/migrations/*.sql`

## Numbering

Files are `NNN_description.sql`, zero-padded to 3 digits, strictly increasing, one migration ahead of the current highest number. Check the current max before creating a new one:

```bash
ls supabase/migrations | sort | tail -1
```

Never renumber or edit an already-merged migration — a migration that already ran in some deployment is immutable. If a merged migration was wrong, write a new migration that corrects it.

### Version collisions from syncing with upstream

This fork and `upstream` (`ArnasDon/wacrm`) each pick "current max + 1" independently, so a migration written on this fork's `main` and one written on upstream's `main` can end up claiming the same number — checking the local max before writing a migration doesn't see numbers upstream added after that point. Merging then fails a clean `supabase db reset` with a duplicate `schema_migrations` key (SQLSTATE 23505); upstream has hit this internally too (see the note at the top of `034_fix_profiles_update_rls.sql`).

There is deliberately **one migration sequence, not two** — Postgres has no concept of parallel migration lines, and maintaining one would just move the collision problem into "which line applies first" instead of removing it. When a sync surfaces a collision:

1. Identify which of the colliding files is this fork's own (not upstream's) — upstream's file keeps its number, since it may already be applied in other forks/deployments of the template.
2. Rename this fork's file to the next free number after the highest number in the merged set (`ls supabase/migrations | sort | tail -1`).
3. Add a one-line note at the top of the renamed file's header explaining the rename (old number, why, and that it's independent of the migrations now sitting between the old and new slot — verify that independence, don't just assert it).
4. Verify with an actual local replay before considering the fix done — `supabase db reset --local --no-seed` followed by `supabase db query --local --file supabase/ci/verify-schema.sql` (matches what `.github/workflows/migrations.yml` runs). Don't rely on `supabase db start` alone; it's a no-op against a database that already exists and won't catch this.
5. This is a fix, not part of the sync merge itself — it goes on its own branch/PR (see `AGENTS.md`'s Git Workflow section), not a direct commit to `main`.

If this fork's migration was already applied to a real deployed Supabase project under the old number before the collision was discovered, the rename only fixes the file going forward — that project's `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` history still has a row for the old number. Reconciling that (or accepting the drift) is a deployment-specific judgment call, not something the file rename resolves by itself.

## Idempotency — every migration must be safe to run twice

Postgres has no `CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS`, so the pattern throughout this repo is:

- `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`
- For anything without an `IF NOT EXISTS` form (policies, triggers, some functions): `DROP ... IF EXISTS` immediately before the `CREATE`
- `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` for functions

Follow this even when you're confident the migration will only ever run once — it's load-bearing for re-applying migrations against a fresh Supabase project.

## Header comment block

Every migration opens with a `-- ====...` banner comment: filename + one-line summary, then prose sections as needed — "Design notes" (why this shape, not just what), "RLS" (policy summary in words), "What this migration does NOT touch" for anything non-obvious it deliberately leaves alone, and always closing with the idempotency note. See `017_account_sharing.sql` or `026_api_keys.sql` for the calibration — this is prose that explains a decision, not a changelog of the SQL below it.

## RLS is mandatory on every new table

1. `ALTER TABLE <name> ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;` immediately after creating the table.
2. Every account-owned table gets an `account_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` column and an index on it.
3. Policies are gated through the `is_account_member(account_id, min_role)` SECURITY DEFINER helper (defined in `017_account_sharing.sql`), never a raw `auth.uid() = user_id` check — that pattern is legacy and pre-dates multi-tenancy.
   - Default role tiers used across the codebase: **viewer+** can `SELECT` operational data; **agent+** can write operational data (contacts, messages, deals); **admin+** can write settings-class data (tags, custom fields, API keys, webhooks). Match the tier to the table's blast radius, not to what's convenient.
4. `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS <name> ON <table>;` before every `CREATE POLICY`, so the file re-applies cleanly.
5. If the table needs to be readable/writable from the public API's service-role client (`src/lib/auth/api-context.ts`), that client bypasses RLS entirely — the policy still matters for the dashboard's cookie-session path, but don't assume it's the only enforcement. The app-layer `.eq('account_id', ctx.accountId)` filter is what protects the service-role path.

## Money / secrets / other constrained columns

- Store secrets as a hash (`text` SHA-256 hex, see `api_keys.key_hash`) or encrypted ciphertext (see `whatsapp_config` token columns), never plaintext. A short non-secret `_prefix` display column is fine for UI (`key_prefix`).
- `ON DELETE SET NULL` for an audit/attribution FK (`created_by`) so removing a teammate doesn't cascade-delete data others depend on; `ON DELETE CASCADE` for genuine ownership (`account_id`).

## After writing the migration

Update `docs/public-api.md` if the change touches anything the public API surfaces (new scope, new endpoint, new response field) — that doc is user-facing and doesn't auto-derive from the schema.
